1. 404 ($OOPS) — Whitepaper
Version 1.0 | May 2025
Introduction
404 ($OOPS) is a decentralized, community-launched memecoin built on the Base blockchain. Inspired by internet glitch culture, ironic detachment, and performance-art-level absurdism, 404 doesn’t offer a roadmap or utility — that is the point.
Purpose
404 exists as a satire of tokenization culture — where function is often an illusion and speculation is the utility. It’s not trying to solve anything. It’s a glitch in the system, tradable and watchable but not fixable.

Ownership is renounced. Liquidity is public. No minting, no hidden functions.
Utility
None — and that's intentional. $OOPS is a token with no use case, no governance, and no function beyond cultural value. It lives on vibes and volume.
Branding
Slogans:
- “The 404 is watching.”
- “Even we don’t know what it does.”
- “You’ve entered the 404 Zone. Leave your expectations at the door.”
Future
No roadmap. No promises. Just memes, mystery, and movement. If it becomes something more, it wasn't planned.
